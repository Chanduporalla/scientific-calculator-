Scientific Calculator Project Overview

This project involves creating a web-based scientific calculator similar to a Casio calculator, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface and functionality for both basic arithmetic and advanced scientific calculations.
Components:

    HTML Structure: The HTML file defines the layout, including a display section and buttons for numbers, operators, and scientific functions. Each button is linked to JavaScript functions for handling calculations.

    CSS Styling: CSS styles the calculator to make it visually appealing and easy to use. The layout uses a grid system to organize buttons, ensuring a clean and intuitive design.

    JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is used to implement the calculator's logic. Key functions include:
        clearDisplay(): Clears the display.
        deleteLast(): Deletes the last character.
        appendToDisplay(value): Adds a character or function to the display.
        calculateResult(): Evaluates and displays the result.

Scientific functions like Math.sin(), Math.cos(), Math.log(), Math.pow(), Math.sqrt(), and constants Math.PI and Math.E are integrated to handle complex calculations.

This project demonstrates the integration of web technologies to create a functional scientific calculator, suitable for educational and professional use. It highlights the power of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and practical web applications.
